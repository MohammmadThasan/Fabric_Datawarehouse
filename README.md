Problem
Data warehouses are essential components of modern analytics systems, offering optimized storage and processing capabilities for large volumes of data. When integrated with a Lakehouse architecture, you can combine the best of both worldsâ€”structured, schema-enforced data storage with the flexibility and scalability of data lakes. Microsoft Fabric provides an excellent environment for implementing the Medallion Architecture, a design pattern for building efficient data processing pipelines by layering data into bronze, silver, and gold zones.

Solution
In this article, I will outline an end-to-end approach to designing a data warehouse using Medallion Architecture in Microsoft Fabric.

What is the Medallion Architecture?
Without going into the nitty-gritty of what a data warehouse entails, I will describe a Medallion Architecture, an approach we will leverage in this article, and best practices on leveraging it.

The Medallion Architecture is a design principle that organizes data into three primary layers:

Bronze Layer: Raw, unfiltered data ingested from various sources. It often includes errors, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Silver Layer: Cleansed and transformed, which can be used for analytics and machine learning.
Gold Layer: Highly curated and aggregated data optimized for business intelligence (BI) reporting and dashboards.
Each layer refines the data, ensuring that data quality and transformation logic are applied as the data progresses from the raw bronze stage to the analytical gold stage.
